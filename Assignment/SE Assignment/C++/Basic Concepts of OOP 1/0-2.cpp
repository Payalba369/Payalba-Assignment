/*What is OOP? List OOP concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
It emphasizes the concept of encapsulating data and behavior within objects, which makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Key Concepts of OOP:

Class:
A blueprint or prototype for creating objects. It defines a data structure that includes data members (attributes) and member functions (methods).


Object:
An instance of a class. Objects represent real-world entities and encapsulate both data and behavior.



Encapsulation:
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.


Abstraction:
The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all the underlying complexity.

Inheritance:
A mechanism that allows a new class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class).
This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.


Polymorphism:
The ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
It allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, often achieved through method overriding or overloading.
